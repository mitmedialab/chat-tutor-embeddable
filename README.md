# ChatTutor Embeddable

This is a complementary UI for [ChatTutor](https://github.com/ChatTutor/chattutor) (and it's associated [chrome extension](https://github.com/ChatTutor/chattutorextension)) built in [svelte](https://svelte.dev/). 

It's primary use is to support deploying ChatTutor in [MIT's 6.100 Spring 2024 course](https://github.com/mitmedialab/6100-spring-chat-tutor-extension/tree/main). 

Test it through [storybook](https://mitmedialab.github.io/chat-tutor-embeddable/main/storybook/?path=/story/root--base)!

# Running

```
npm run dev
```

The above command will start the storybook server, where you can view and interact with all of this repo's UI components. 

To view the 'entry' point for the UI (the `Root` component), navigate to: [localhost:6006/?path=/story/root--base](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/root--base)
