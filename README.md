# ChatTutor Embeddable

This is a complementary UI for [ChatTutor](https://github.com/ChatTutor/chattutor) (and it's associated [chrome extension](https://github.com/ChatTutor/chattutorextension)) built in svelte. 

It's primary use is to support deploying ChatTutor in [MIT's 6.100 Spring 2024 course](https://github.com/mitmedialab/6100-spring-chat-tutor-extension/tree/main). 

Test it through [storybook](https://mitmedialab.github.io/chat-tutor-embeddable/main/storybook/?path=/story/root--base)!!!
